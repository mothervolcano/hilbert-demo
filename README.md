### Intro

FASS is a proof-of-concept project to test a L-System framework being developed in the context of non-parametric tile-based L-Systems.

More information about the framework can be found at the repository of another proof-of-concept project, [Arborator](https://github.com/mothervolcano/arborator).

FASS is an acronym for spaceÂ­ filling, self-avoiding, simple and self-similar.
